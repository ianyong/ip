# Duke | User Guide

![Duke](Ui.png)

Duke is a *Personal Assistant Chatbot* with task management functionality.
Keep track of all your tasks with ease!

## Features

### Manage Your Tasks

To best cater to your task management needs, Duke supports the creation of three different types of tasks:
- Deadlines
- Events
- Todos

#### Deadlines

Deadlines are tasks that have to be completed by a specific date and time.

#### Events

Events are tasks that occur at a specific date and time.

#### Todos

Todos are tasks that do not have a specific date and time attached to them.

All of the above tasks track whether they have been completed.
In addition, for deadline and event tasks, Duke is able to filter by overdue and upcoming tasks.
